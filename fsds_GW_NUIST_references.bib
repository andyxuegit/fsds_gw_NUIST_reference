	abstract = {This article identifies proxies which account for the impacts that the Airbnb platform is having on housing in Greater London. We identify these by analysing the relationships between possible Airbnb misuse and the attributes of housing in the same locations. We assume misuse when listings of entire properties within the Airbnb platform do not conform with local regulations and where hosts who offer such housing have multiple listings. In particular, we examine (1) the dwelling type based on building typology; (2) the type of housing tenure, whether it is owned or rented; and (3) the spatial distribution of changes in rent payable. Three important findings emerge from our analysis. First, based on 2018 data, we estimate that more than 2\% of all properties in London, and up to 7\% in some local areas are being misused through Airbnb as short-term holiday rentals. Second, the location of these particular Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with the diversity of dwelling types and positively correlated with dwelling type such as an apartment (or flat) in areas of high private rental stock. Last, we show that a 100\% increase in the density of possible Airbnb misuse can be associated with up to an 8\% increase in unit rental price per-bedroom per-week, an equivalent to up to an average of £90 price increase per year. Finally, we discuss how this type of analysis can help build instruments to inform policies associated with the platform economy in relation to increasing polarisation in the London housing market.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we assess the impact of Airbnb on housing rents and prices in the city of Barcelona. Examining very detailed data on rents and both transaction and posted prices, we use several econometric approaches that exploit the exact timing and geography of Airbnb activity in the city. These include i) panel ﬁxed-eﬀects models, where we run multiple speciﬁcations that allow for diﬀerent forms of heterogeneous time trends across neighborhoods, ii) an instrumental variables shift-share approach in which tourist amenities predict where Airbnb listings will locate and Google searches predict when listings appear, iii) event-study designs, and iv) ﬁnally, we present evidence from Sagrada Familia, a major tourist amenity that is not found in the city centre. Our main results imply that for the average neighborhood, Airbnb activity has increased rents by 1.9\%, transaction prices by 4.6\% and posted prices by 3.7\%. The estimated impact in neighborhoods with high Airbnb activity is substantial. For neighborhoods in the top decile of Airbnb activity distribution, rents are estimated to have increased by 7\%, while increases in transaction (posted) prices are estimated at 17\% (14\%).},

	abstract = {This paper examines the impact of Airbnb on the local rental housing market. Airbnb provides landlords an alternative opportunity to rent to short-term tourists, potentially leading some landlords to switch from long-term rentals and thereby, affecting rental housing supply and affordability. Despite recent government regulations to address this concern, it remains unclear how many and what types of properties are switching. Combining Airbnb and American Housing Survey data, we estimate a structural model of property owners’ decisions and conduct counterfactual analyses to evaluate various regulations. We ﬁnd that Airbnb mildly cannibalizes the long-term rental supply. Cities where Airbnb is more popular experience a larger rental supply reduction, but they do not necessarily have a larger percentage of switchers. Affordable units are the major sources of both the negative and positive impacts of Airbnb. They cause a larger rental supply reduction, which harms local renters; they also create a larger market expansion effect, which beneﬁts local hosts who own affordable units and may be less economically advantaged. Policy makers need to strike a balance between local renters’ affordable housing concerns and local hosts’ income source needs. We also ﬁnd that imposing a linear tax is more desirable than limiting the number of days a property can be listed. We propose a new convex tax that imposes a higher tax on expensive units and show that it can outperform existing policies in terms of reducing cannibalization and alleviating social inequality. Finally, Airbnb and rent control can exacerbate each other’s negative impacts.},

We ﬁnd that on average a 1pp increase in a municipality Airbnb share results in a 3.7\% increase in house prices. When zooming our analysis to the main cities of Lisbon and Porto, we ﬁnd that a 1pp increase in a civil parish Airbnb share leads to a 3.2\% price increase. Finally, exploring the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of Airbnb within the two cities we ﬁnd strong effects localized in the historical centers and areas attractive to tourists. Compared to a low touristy parish, house prices in a high touristy parish increased by 24.3\% in 2015 and 32.3\% in the 1st quarter of 2016, relatively to pre-Airbnb expansion period (pre-2014Q2).},

	abstract = {This paper considers the linkages between the home-sharing platform Airbnb and the housing crisis in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), in Ireland. This area is in the midst of a housing crisis, with a signiﬁcant undersupply of housing units and rising unaffordability, especially the city of Dublin. While the sharing economy, better exempliﬁed here by Airbnb, has become a major part of the global economy, it is less clear what is the regional impact of Airbnb, an online platform that allows people rent out part or all of their home for short stays. Among the claimed beneﬁts for the tourism sector there are concerns that home sharing removes potential housing supply from the private rental sector to the short-term rental sector, which could aggravate the housing shortage. Along these lines, this paper documents this contemporary urban spatial issue, using rental asking prices data and data from Airbnb listings. The study does not intend to criticize the sharing platforms themselves but rather their disruptive impact and the short-term rental market within a digital economy context more widely. It is found that whilst not the only factor for the current housing crisis in Greater Dublin, Airbnb’s presence in the short-term housing is a vivid element of the current housing crisis in the country, which poses challenges for regulators and home seekers.},

In order to understand the true impact of P2Psharing on the tourism and hospitality landscape, it is important to understand that market in detail first. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the development of the Airbnb market over the last seven years in Paris, the most popular destination for Airbnb guests with more than 40,000 accommodation rentals. This research note is a summary of our findings on the Paris market. Our study shows different growth and seasonality patterns for Airbnb and hotels and dissimilarities in the geographical location of the offers. The findings indicate that the two products are not in direct competition and that their relationship might be more complex than previously thought. We trust that exploring the nature of the competitive relationship would be a valuable avenue for further investigation.},

	abstract = {The growth of the sharing economy has received increasing attention from economists. Some researchers have examined how these new business models shape market mechanisms and, in the case of home sharing, economists have examined how the sharing economy affects the hotel industry. There is currently limited evidence on whether home sharing affects the housing market, despite the obvious overlap between these two markets. As a result, policy makers grappling with the effects of the rapid growth of home sharing have inadequate information on which to make reasoned policy decisions. In this paper, we add to the small but growing body of knowledge on how the sharing economy is shaping the housing market by focusing on the short-term effects of the growth of Airbnb in Boston neighborhoods on the rental market, relying on individual rental listings. We examine whether the increasing presence of Airbnb raises asking rents and whether the change in rents may be driven by a decline in the supply of housing offered for rent. We show that a one standard deviation increase in Airbnb listings is associated with an increase in asking rents of 0.4\%.},
